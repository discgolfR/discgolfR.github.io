Welcome to discgolfR - a site about disc golf data analysis using the programming language R!

My intention is to use this site as a place to investigate things about disc golf that I find interesting, practice my data science skills in my free time, and generally discuss, learn, and share about two of my favorite hobbies: disc golf and R.
