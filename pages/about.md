Welcome to Disc Golf Data - a site about disc golf data analysis and visualization!

My intention is to use this site as a place to investigate things about disc golf that I find interesting, practice my data science skills in my free time, and generally discuss, learn, and share about two of my favorite hobbies: disc golf and dataviz.
