Welcome to this new project I'm calling discgolfR!

Click to read more.

My intention is to post data analysis about disc golf using the programming language R. I use R for my day-to-day work and applying that skillset to disc golf data allows me to practice new workflows on a topic I really love. I have already begun cooking up some analysis looking at the most discussed discs using Reddit comment data and also changes in disc shape/attributes over the past ~30 years. Look for these posts in the coming days!

Happy new year to anyone who finds this little project site!

Peace,

John
